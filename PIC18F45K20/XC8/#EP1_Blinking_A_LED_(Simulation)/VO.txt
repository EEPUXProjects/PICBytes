Discuss schematic
Show Current Sinking and sourcing options and discuss difference. Direction of diode.
Discuss max current of each port and total current output
Calculate how much current the led draws and calculate the resistance

Discuss and setup code
Delay routine
difference between TRIS, PORT and LATC and using full port or single pin with custom name
show turning led fully on , fully off and flashing.

Simulation
Modify delay for faster blinking
